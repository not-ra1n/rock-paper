I want to have a function that allows me to decide the winner



let playerSelection-lower = playerSelection.toLowerCase()



If user inputs rock and computer inputs rock then
= draw = replay round

If user inputs rock and computer inputs paper then
= You Lose! Paper beats Rock

If user inputs rock and computer inputs scissors then =
You win! Rock beats Scissors


If user inputs scissors and computer inputs scissors then
= draw = replay round

If user inputs scissors and computer inputs rock then
= You lose! Rock beats scissors

If user inputs scissors and computer inputs paper then 
= You win! Scissors beats paper


If user inputs paper and computer inputs paper then 
= draw = replay round

If user inputs paper and computer inputs scissors then 
= You lose! Scissors beats paper!

If user inputs paper and computer inputs rock then
= You win! Paper beats rock!


let tie =

[playerSelection = rock && computerSelection = rock] ||
[playerSelection = paper && computerSelection = paper] ||
[playerSelection = scissor && computerSelection = scissor]

if (tie) {
    replay round (don't let this count as an official round of the 5 rounds)
    return playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection)
}


Create a game function that used the previous function to play a best-of-five game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end 

If you win, then increment your score by 1

If you lose, increment computer score by 1

If you have 3 wins, register "You won the best of 5!"

If computer has 3 wins, register "You lost! The computer won the best of !"
